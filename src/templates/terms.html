					For many years, when people thought of alcohol and drug rehab, the image that almost immediately came to mind was most likely a group of people, sitting in a circle in folding chairs in a big vacant room. Its true <a href="">that group programs</a> still aid many people in their quest to stop drinking and using illegal substances but most who have fell too deep into their addictions do not find relief this way. There is good news for those who need help getting over their addictions – slowly, there has been a proliferation of alternative therapies to alcohol and drug rehab. These methods may prove useful when traditional rehabilitation methods fail. 1. Why Do People Get Addictions?
					<br><br>
					The reasons for addiction are complicated and vary with each and every individual. These same reasons may be difficult for us to understand, and even a lot more difficult to resolve. Drug and alcohol rehab in recent years has taken a hard and diverse approach to the problem of addiction. Taking in consideration are the physical, emotional, and even nutritional factors that may be causes. Whether you’re seeking help for yourself or whether you are a concerned friend or family member of someone who is in a very dangerous grip of addiction, be confident that you are not the only one. Addictions come in varied forms, some are dangerous and some are not. 2. The Physiological Approach
					<br><br>
					It doesn’t mean that just because you are encountering a dangerous addiction it’s alright to think that you are different from everyone else. It only means that you’ll need to seek out specially qualified help. Many physiological and chemical imbalances that occur in our bodies and brains may contribute or cause our feelings of depression, that can lead us into addiction as we try to self medicate to compensate for our emotional distress. We are living in an era where many problems like chemical depression and blood sugar imbalances are easily diagnosed and treated. Often, addicts who treat these underlying problems will experience great relief from the urge to feel better by drinking.
					<br><br>
					3. Blood Chemistry
					<br><br>
					The best and most popular idea we have of drug rehabilitation is the old 12-step group therapy that we so often see on television shows and movies. The fact is, science has a lot more to tell us about how our bodies and brains respond to all kinds of substances. A lot of evidence suggests that when a physiological or chemical imbalance is occurs in the brain no matter what the cause, that individual will try to compensate for the imbalance he is experiencing by self-medicating with drugs. Modern drug rehab programs often use this approach to look for chemical brain imbalances to help their patients recover. In addition to this, imbalances in blood chemistry can also lead to drug and alcohol addiction. Having problems such as low blood sugar can lead someone to self medicate so that he can cure any fatigue or anxiety that he may be feeling. A balanced nutritional intake and exercise have shown themselves to be aids in the process of drug rehab. 
					<br><br>
					Usually people who are deeply addicted often have neglected themselves, so by finding a diet and exercise program, it can really lift their self image. Another advantage of exercise to anyone who is an addict is that it also provides a natural high that can help an addict to get through the rough periods in his rehabilitation. Some individuals may be comfortable with the idea of group counseling while some may have difficulty in comprehending it. An option for these kinds of people is one on one therapy, where a therapist can reach out to the deepest and most personal aspects of an addict’s life. Looking for answers for addiction and possible recovery is an extremely difficult task to anyone. It takes a lot of devotion and time to even see the smallest of developments. Being able to find the right place to do the work toward recovery is an important step. The wants needs of each and every addict are different from each other, and the process of finding a place to fully recover can be a very deep, difficult, personal and intense process.
